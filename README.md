# Guess-My-Number-Game
JavaScript Tutorial (This is a JS ES-6 learning project)
Description:
The player must select a number between 1 to 20 to match a random number chosen by the computer within the same range. If the guess is correct then the point of the player reduces by 1 (maximum point is 1). If the guessed number is correct then the user's current score is stored if no high score is present and a success message is displayed.
Key features:
* Number must be selected between 1-20
* User gets a chance to try again.
* When a number is chosen by the user, there would be three scenarios (let computer's number =10):
  1. if user selects less than 10, message displayed: Too low
  2. if user selects higher than 10, message displayed: Too high
  3. if user selects correct number then message displayed: Correct number!
* Highscore for the current session is stored.
* If user hits try again after one successful game, high score is stored.

  Technology used:
  * HTML5
  * CSS3
  * JavaScript ES6
